# GitHub Stars

## Areas that I would improve on a normal day
- I had a mental block when it came to where to display the commits. The commits deserve more love.
- Did not write tests, but tried to account for API failures. Error states deserve more love.
- Lack of color and visual flair, your eyes deserve better.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
